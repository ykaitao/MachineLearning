The **Exponential Family** is a broad class of probability distributions that share a specific mathematical form. Many common distributions, such as the Gaussian, Bernoulli, Poisson, and Gamma distributions, belong to this family. The Exponential Family is important in statistics and machine learning because it provides a unified framework for modeling and inference. Let’s derive the general form of the **probability density function (PDF)** or **probability mass function (PMF)** for distributions in the Exponential Family.

---

### **1. Definition of the Exponential Family**
A distribution belongs to the Exponential Family if its PDF or PMF can be written in the following form:
\[
f(x | \theta) = h(x) \exp\left(\eta(\theta)^T T(x) - A(\theta)\right),
\]
where:
- \( x \): The random variable (can be scalar or vector),
- \( \theta \): The natural parameter (a vector for multivariate distributions),
- \( T(x) \): The sufficient statistic (a function of \( x \)),
- \( \eta(\theta) \): The natural parameter (a function of \( \theta \)),
- \( h(x) \): The base measure (a function of \( x \)),
- \( A(\theta) \): The log-partition function (ensures normalization).

---

### **2. Derivation of the Exponential Family Form**
The Exponential Family form is derived by expressing the PDF or PMF in a specific exponential form. Here’s how it works:

#### **Step 1: Start with the PDF or PMF**
Consider a distribution with PDF or PMF \( f(x | \theta) \), where \( \theta \) is the parameter of the distribution.

#### **Step 2: Rewrite in Exponential Form**
Rewrite the PDF or PMF in the form:
\[
f(x | \theta) = h(x) \exp\left(\eta(\theta)^T T(x) - A(\theta)\right).
\]
This form separates the dependence on \( x \) and \( \theta \) into distinct terms.

#### **Step 3: Identify the Components**
- \( h(x) \): Captures the dependence on \( x \) that is independent of \( \theta \),
- \( \eta(\theta) \): Maps the parameter \( \theta \) to the natural parameter space,
- \( T(x) \): Summarizes the data \( x \) in a way that is sufficient for \( \theta \),
- \( A(\theta) \): Ensures the PDF or PMF integrates (or sums) to 1.

#### **Step 4: Log-Partition Function**
The log-partition function \( A(\theta) \) is defined as:
\[
A(\theta) = \log \left( \int h(x) \exp\left(\eta(\theta)^T T(x)\right) \, dx \right).
\]
For discrete distributions, replace the integral with a sum.

### **3. Examples of Exponential Family Distributions**

#### **Gaussian Distribution**
- PDF:
  \[
  f(x | \mu, \sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right).
  \]
- Exponential Family Form:
  \[
  f(x | \theta) = \exp\left(\frac{\mu}{\sigma^2} x - \frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2} - \frac{\mu^2}{2\sigma^2} - \frac{1}{2} \log(2\pi \sigma^2)\right).
  \]
  Here:
  - \( \eta(\theta) = \left(\frac{\mu}{\sigma^2}, -\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\right) \),
  - \( T(x) = (x, x^2) \),
  - \( h(x) = 1 \),
  - \( A(\theta) = \frac{\mu^2}{2\sigma^2} + \frac{1}{2} \log(2\pi \sigma^2) \).

#### **Bernoulli Distribution**
- PMF:
  \[
  f(x | p) = p^x (1-p)^{1-x}, \quad x \in \{0, 1\}.
  \]
- Exponential Family Form:
  \[
  f(x | \theta) = \exp\left(x \log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) + \log(1-p)\right).
  \]
  Here:
  - \( \eta(\theta) = \log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) \),
  - \( T(x) = x \),
  - \( h(x) = 1 \),
  - \( A(\theta) = -\log(1-p) \).

#### **Poisson Distribution**
- PMF:
  \[
  f(x | \lambda) = \frac{\lambda^x e^{-\lambda}}{x!}, \quad x = 0, 1, 2, \dots.
  \]
- Exponential Family Form:
  \[
  f(x | \theta) = \exp\left(x \log \lambda - \lambda - \log(x!)\right).
  \]
  Here:
  - \( \eta(\theta) = \log \lambda \),
  - \( T(x) = x \),
  - \( h(x) = \frac{1}{x!} \),
  - \( A(\theta) = \lambda \).

---

### **4. Key Properties of the Exponential Family**
- **Sufficient Statistics**: \( T(x) \) captures all the information about \( \theta \) contained in \( x \).
- **Conjugate Priors**: The Exponential Family has natural conjugate priors, simplifying Bayesian inference.
- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**: The log-likelihood is concave, making optimization easier.

---

### **5. Use Case**
The Exponential Family is used to model:
- A wide range of distributions in statistics and machine learning,
- Generalized Linear Models (GLMs),
- Bayesian inference and conjugate priors.

---

### **Summary**
The PDF or PMF of a distribution in the Exponential Family is:
\[
f(x | \theta) = h(x) \exp\left(\eta(\theta)^T T(x) - A(\theta)\right).
\]
